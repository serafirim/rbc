## React Boilerplate Clean
 Here we have a clean boilerplate code for creating a React app without the unnecessary fluff - ready to go!

## Installation

### Clone it!

    git clone https://github.com/serafirim/rbc.git

### Set it up!

(Optional) Step 0: Change the name of the directory from "rbc" to whatever you want to call your project.

Step 1: After changing into the directory you cloned RBC into, run the following:

    npm i

in the root directory.

Step 2: Next run the following to start it:

    npm start

in the root directory.

(Optional) Step 3: If you want to upload a project built with this, please run the following:

    rm -r .git

as it might cause problems with creating your new git project, but you should already know about this. 

*NOTE: You may need to run this command as sudo*

### Profit?

Do you want with this. Yeah, you can do it.  Yep
